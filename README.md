# HMM-codes-for-anomaly-detection
These codes utilize Hidden Markov Models and Symbolic Time Series Analysis for anomaly detection using short-length sensor time series with application to low-delay detection of thermoacoustic instabilities (TAI).
The codes uses "Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Toolbox for Matlab" written by Kevin Murphy available for free at https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html according to the license  https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
