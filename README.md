# HMM-codes-for-anomaly-detection
These codes utilize HMM for anomaly detection using short-length sensor time series with application to low-delay detection of thermoacoustic instabilities (TAI).
The codes uses "Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Toolbox for Matlab" written by Kevin Murphy available for free at https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
